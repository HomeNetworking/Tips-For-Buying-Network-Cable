How to add users or computers to your home wireless network

Wireless network connection is a way that our computers communicate with each other. This is done through infrared signals or even with Bluetooth connection. Wireless technology was developed because the accessibility and the need to have an easier to install form of networking that can also be installed and ran inside the home. People use wireless networking just like a regular LAN or local area networks. They use it transfer data, share resources like printers, fax machines and other computer peripherals.

Even though LAN is still the most conventional way of connecting your computer with each other wireless networks or wireless LAN is becoming more and more popular. One reason is because of its simple hooking up process.

The advantages of wireless networks are being able to hook up dozens of computers to the internet and paying only just one line. Another advantage is the simplicity of installation. The tedious task of cabling your whole house for the network is eliminated by the wireless connection. This would mean that you don't have to lay down the wires and cables throughout your house and in the end calling a professional installer because it's just to tasking.

Wireless networking is also ideal if you would like to maximize your resources by utilizing only one printer or scanner for your whole household. This is an advantage to people who have more than one computer at home but doesn't want a separate printer for each computer. Maximizing your resources is of course top priority.

Wireless connection deploys the use of several pieces of equipment to accomplish the job. This would include modems, routers, network hubs (if needed), wireless NIC, LAN cards and of course an internet connection on a host computer.

The schematics of a wireless network is quite simple. The host computer has the modem that is connected to the internet. Usually host computers or servers are desktops are capable of handling large amounts of data at one time. After hooking up the host computer to the internet via modem the fun begins. Installation of the LAN card is the next step, this is done to prep the host computer that there will be more than one device that will utilize the internet.

After installing the LAN card, you should have the host computer hook up a wireless router. A wireless router enables other peripherals that will be sharing a connection to have the same speed as the host computer. Before the use of the router, computers split the speed of the connection when they are networked.

Because of the router the speed of the connection is not broken down. Network hubs are like the terminals that allow more than one computer to be hooked up to the internet and to have a communication link to the other computers that are in the network. But because of the wireless age hubs are steadily being replaced by routers that are already wireless. Wireless routers already act as the terminals for the other computers that are going to be hooked up.

A wireless NIC or network interface card is the device that allows a single computer unit to act as one with the whole network. The wireless NIC is the device that replaces an NIC that is built-in with your computer. Wireless NIC's acts as the invisible cable between your computer and the router.

When you have your own network in place and let's just say that a friend comes over with a laptop and he wants to have it hooked up to your internet connection or he needs to print something using your network printer. How do you do it?

How do you hook his computer to the LAN or your wireless network? If it was wired LAN there would be no problem, all he needs to do is to get a wire and hook it up. But a wireless connection it's a little more complicated than that. Because wireless networks rely mainly on invisible cables that are made in the router, the connection should be secure to prevent other people from using your resources.

That's why there are wireless networks that ask for a network password. To add another computer or device to your home wireless network, start by going to the CONTROL PANEL. Then click on NETWORK and INTERNET CONNECTIONS and click on the WIRELESS NETWORK SETUP WIZARD.

This will automatically detect the new computer you're trying to hook up. And the after it done checking everything manually assign a network key so you can add a new device to the wireless network. Simple enough? Good.
